                    <p>Mozilla Firefox Club is proud to present you all with "Bug Venture",
                        the game of Bugs and brains, a quest in which you will solve bugs
                        to get such questions which will bend your mind and make you think
                        twice about your capabilities and your choices. Your every choice
                        might take you to a different turn... But only one path will lead
                        you to the victory so do you have what it takes to be the "Usain Bolt"
                        of the world of finding Bugs and making correct choices?
